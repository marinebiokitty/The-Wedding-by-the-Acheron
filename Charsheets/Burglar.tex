    Any book of Etruscan history can tell you how their nation rose to power. Less than a century ago, the Coroni, a tribe of exiled nobles from the eastern deserts, rose up against the Etruscan lords who had welcomed them in. Led by their would-be king, Hyperion Coronus, they crushed Etruria?s peasant militia, sacked its capitol, and put the Etruscan Queen, her retinue, and her family to death. In the years that followed, King Hyperion relentlessly tracked down every trace of the old Etruscan dynasty, seeking to erase their name forever. One by one, the scions of that ancient family were slaughtered, until at last no one was left to avenge the fallen queen ? no one who could carry on her lineage, no one who could reclaim her throne. Now, the Coroni rule unchallenged, and the Etruscans that came before them are nothing but a memory. 

    But you know that all those history books are wrong. And you yourself are living proof. You tell the others that you are Delia, the fortune-teller. But your true name is Lilaiomene, and the kingdom of Etruria is your birthright ? for you are the last remnant of a royal house that can be traced back to the Emerald Huntress herself, in the mythic era of your nation?s birth. Those are the stories you tell yourself in your daydreams ? that you are the proudest and most regal of the old warrior-queens reborn, that you will single-handedly strike down Hiems the usurper-king and his bloody-handed dynasty and restore Etruria?s honor. Do you know any of this for sure? Of course not. But hope is headier and more intoxicating than the strongest drink.

    But other things, sadder things, you know are true. Your mother died stinking of filth and despair, wracked by the pangs of childbirth and dishonored by the brutal squalor of King Hiems?s prison camps. His soldiers, unaware of your true identity, cast you out on the rugged slopes of Mount Morophon as food for the vultures and the jackals, hoping that the elements would finish what the Coroni started. As far as King Hiems was concerned, that was the end of the line: the Etruscan queens were dead and gone forever. But you didn?t die. 

    A gang of roustabouts, grifters, and ne?er-do-wells, who had made camp on the mountain?s slopes after being cast out of Etruria?s capital city, proved themselves that day kinder and more noble than any in the Coroni?s royal court. They plucked you from among the jagged cairns and raised you as one of their own. As your adoptive father Cynesios used to fondly say, ?We?re all outcasts here, child. The least we could do was take care of another like us.? As you grew into a young girl, his wife, the kind but sharp-witted swindler Neumia, always remarked on how much you resembled Etruria?s half-forgotten Queen. 

    Your adoptive family wandered from place to place, camping in sparse forests and dewy vales, and you grew older with the seasons. Unwelcome in cities and shunned by even the poorest farmers, they made a living however they could ? performing, begging, stealing. You took to the art of thievery as soon as you tried it, and became quite skilled indeed at sneaking into the homes and bank-vaults of the rich and depriving them of their dusty treasures. You loved the thrill of the profession, the way your pulse pounded as you crept through empty halls or slipped between the bars of a high window. Even after Cynesios died peacefully in his sleep one moonlit November night, and the troupe drifted apart in sorrow, you stuck to your chosen profession. 

    And you made a pretty penny for yourself along the way ? not to mention a reputation for competence and stealth across the Sabine states. You were one of the best ? perhaps the best. As time passed, you found yourself highly sought-after by wealthy clients looking to ?liberate? a rival?s prized trophy or ancient heirloom. You seldom failed to fulfill a contract ? and, though you?re wanted for dozens of high-profile burglaries in Scythia, Etruria, and Assyria, the law has only been able to touch you once. And that wasn?t your fault. You were infiltrating an Assyrian museum of art with a team of local sneak thieves, only to realize that they?d been paid off to set you up and turn you in to the authorities. You always knew there was a reason you preferred working alone.

    Thankfully, it seems you have as many friends as enemies. As you cooled your heels in a prison cell, one of the guards slipped you a scroll alongside your daily gruel. The anonymous letter advised you that a job awaited you once you escaped: it recommended that you insinuate yourself into the retinue of Scythia?s king as a diviner, and attend the royal wedding. Oh, and it mentioned that the guard who?d slipped you the scroll had been bribed to assist in your escape. So escape you did ? and as you made your way towards Scythia, more of the unsigned letters followed, filling you in on the details of the robbery. 

    Your instructions were simple. One of the wealthiest men to attend the wedding is an Etrurian merchant of luxuries named Paldeen. He?s bringing many of his most expensive wares with him, including the fabled Diadem of Smaragdos, lost for generations. So, naturally, it?s the Diadem that you?re supposed to steal, and later deposit at a secluded point on the isle of Cos for your benefactor to retrieve at their convenience. What a surprise. Once you saw the guest list for the wedding, though, you realized that this caper would make your name as perhaps the most talented thief to ever travel the roads of Scythia. To rob this hapless merchant blind under the noses of royalty will be oh so very satisfying ? and what?s more, you suspect you know who your employer is. One of the attendees is a Scythian arms dealer named Fresi, a woman you?ve heard is an old rival of Paldeen?s ? and, more importantly, she has the power to make you a very rich thief indeed. The matter of your payment is simple enough ? according to the letters, you?re welcome to keep whatever you can steal from Paldeen, with the exception of the Diadem itself. Plus a substantial bonus.

    Your benefactor also provided you with a set of skillfully forged documents establishing you as a Scythian commoner with a talent for fortunetelling, making it child?s play for you to join the hangers-on and sycophants of the royal court. Now you?re on your way to the wedding. Unfortunately, not everything?s working out so smoothly. You?re being pressured by another of the wedding guests, a member of the ancient and malicious order of Blackguards, to participate in her own schemes. She knows entirely too much about who you are ? and she?s willing to turn you over to the Assyrian authorities if you don?t follow her instructions. This is less than ideal, given that you?ve already been sentenced to death there and would very much like to avoid that particular fate. Nevertheless, you don?t think you could bring yourself to commit murder on your blackmailer?s orders, no matter how much leverage she has ? it just feels wrong. 

    Finally, the king of Etruria, Hiems Coronus, will also be in attendance, as will his two sons, Felix and Salo. It was his family that imprisoned your mother, brought about her death, and left you to die on a distant mountainside. You have no love for this heartless bastard of a man, and quite a bit of hatred. If you can find any way at all to get back at Hiems for his father?s crimes, you?d very much like to make him pay however you can. But you?re not sure how ? you?re a robber, after all, not an assassin. And revenge, however justifiable, always seems to get people in more trouble than it?s worth ? so you?d like to focus on the task at hand first.
