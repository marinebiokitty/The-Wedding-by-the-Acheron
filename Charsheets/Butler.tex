Born November 7, in the year 276.

Nobody lives happily ever after, but I swear I'll still try.

I grew up cursed by my own talents. My father was Memnon, one of the celebrated Scythian Soulblades, but he proclaimed at my birth that I had more potential than any other mage, ever. He therefore inducted me into the horrors of life and death magic when I was still a small child, and my earliest memories were filled with the rattling of bells, the murmuring of malevolent ghosts, with black zigzags that stuck to me like bandages on a mummy. The black magic nearly drove me insane, and I fled when I was just nine, running for miles to non-magical relatives on my mother's side. I never had to go back to Scythia's Soulblade Quarter, because it was raided soon afterwards, thanks to the vigilant \cScythiaQueen{\Monarch} \cScythiaQueen{}. It turned out the Soulblades had been breaking the law with their necromancy, for the Scythians allowed them to practice healing magic and nothing else. Father was jailed for life, and I never saw him again.

Thus, a new chapter began. I dropped out of school at fifteen-- though I still read widely and am hardly ignorant-- with hopes of working in the palace. I was personally interviewed by\cScythiaQueen{\Monarch} \cScythiaQueen{}, and \cScythiaQueen{\they} asked whether I had indeed abandoned the Soulblades, whom \cScythiaQueen{\they} openly opposes; I promised I had left them entirely, and I suspect \cScythiaQueen{\they} verified my answer with royal divination magic. Soon afterwards, I began as a server in the dining halls and rose through the ranks, performing my duties as diligently and elegantly as possible. I am quite loyal to Scythia and glad to serve it, and the orderly nature of palace life was a comfort after my chaotic childhood.

But a few years ago, my world was thrown back into disarray. There was a ball at the Scythian palace, in honor of the crown \cBride{\prince} \cBride{}, who had recently returned from law school in Assyria. Before, I thought of \cBride{\them} as a coltish adolescent, but I now saw an angel in white and gold robes, radiant with some inner joy. Enthralled, I continued to watch \cBride{\them}. At first, I could do nothing but admire \cBride{\them}, like a fine statue, for \cBride{\they} seemed too perfect to be real. But I slowly discerned something underneath the brilliance-- anxiety, and a depth of pain-- and I fell in love. 

Loving \cBride{\them} hurts, though. The more I watched \cBride{\them}, the more I grieved, for \cBride{\they} clearly struggles with great burdens. \cBride{\Their} \cFugitive{\sibling} disappeared, yes, but I can't help feeling that \cBride{}'s suffering from fresher pain as well. Soon afterwards, I was promoted to steward, the top position in the servants' hierarchy, so I had the freedom to move throughout the whole palace at all hours and observe \cBride{\them} more closely. What I found stunned me-- \cBride{\they} was an alcoholic.

I immediately knew I had to help \cBride{\them}. And so, after so many years of shunning Soul Magic, I returned to magic. Though the Soulblades had never found a cure for alcoholism, I threw my efforts into the search and, after a few months of experimentation, concocted a partial remedy; while I could not guarantee that \cBride{\they} would be healed, I would at least increase \cBride{\their} chances of recovery. So I slipped the cure into \cBride{\their} soup at dinner, and, from the next day on, \cBride{\they} ceased drinking. I rejoiced, thrilled to have helped \cBride{\them}.

Then, six months ago, I learned that \cEtruriaKing{\Monarch} \cEtruriaKing{} of Etruria and \cScythiaKing{\Monarch} \cScythiaKing{} of Scythia had arranged a marriage between \cBride{} and the Etruscan crown \cGroom{\prince} \cGroom{}, in order to fulfill an ancient prophecy and prevent civil war. Immediately, I could sense \cBride{}'s mental state deteriorating, though \cBride{\they} hid the distress well from the rest of the world. And so, I began to dread this wedding, partially out of envy, more because of my concern for \cBride{\them}.

I have only a few ways to help \cBride{\them} now. I fear \cBride{\they} will turn back to alcohol, and so I must remove undue temptation from \cBride{\their} path. Upper-class weddings always come paired with loathsome side parties hidden in the corners of the venue, where noblemen lose themselves to debauchery and lose quite a bit of money gambling in the process. While I have always found these gatherings distasteful-- it pains me to see nobles, normally so elegant and composed, debase themselves-- I haven't stepped in. This time, though, I must be a spoilsport, for I won't let their carrying-on risk \cBride{}'s sobriety. In the case that I fail, I have brought in the ingredients for the remedy I slipped \cBride{\them} last time, but, as it is not a guaranteed cure, I would prefer to avoid a relapse in the first place.

These are small ways to help \cBride{}, and I worry that I cannot even do this much, once \cBride{\they} is married and moves to Etruria with \cGroom{}, who is a few years older. Once \cBride{\they} goes, I know I will never be happy again. Thus, for months now, I have dreamed of running away with \cBride{} and eloping. I haven't gone through with this foolish notion-- I suspect \cBride{\their} disappearance would hinder Scythian political affairs, and, more importantly, I don't even know how \cBride{} feels about me. But if this wedding threatens \cBride{\their} health and sanity too greatly, I will confess my feelings for \cBride{\them}. I'll ask \cBride{\them} to break off \cBride{\their} engagement with \cGroom{} and perhaps consider me instead, though I am naught but a lowly steward. 

I wonder what other surprises will be lurking on this island. While I've never heard of Cos, I remember the name ``Acheron''-- the bay where Cos is located-- from those horrific Soulblade chants inflicted on me as a child. The word ``ghost'' was always close by. Those two words have resurfaced in my dreams, recently, along with strange golden sigils I've never seen before. They've made me curious, and I intend to investigate any signs of the paranormal.

Moreover, I've recently received a message from the Soulblades, sent to anyone who's ever studied with them. It warns that the Blackguards, their ancient, anti-magic rivals, intend to strike once more, and are likely aiming at this wedding. As the Blackguards were renowned as skilled assassins, \cBride{}'s life might very well be at risk. I want to defend \cBride{\them}, but, as a Soulblade, I may be a target as well. Thus, I should engage in magical activities quietly and try to avoid the Blackguards' notice, for even ex-Soulblades may incur their wrath.

If all goes fairly well, \cBride{} and \cGroom{} shall be married tomorrow. If all goes perfectly, \cBride{} will be married, and to me. But should the Blackguards strike \cBride{\them} down, we may still have our ``happy ever after,'' if not in this world, then in the next . . .

Note: The white rose is a symbol of the Blackguards. If you see roses in game, you may want to keep an eye on them.
