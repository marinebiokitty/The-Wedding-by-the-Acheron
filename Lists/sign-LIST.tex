%% This file sets up the Sign and Label datatypes and creates Sign and
%% Label macros.
%%
%% Signs generally represent interesting parts of game area, usually
%% as things posted on walls.  Labels represent other things, often on
%% or inside envelopes, that are part of complex mechanics.
%%
%% The default value for \MYloc will inherit location from the Place
%% or Sign most immediately up the ownership tree.  Override this by
%% setting \MYloc to anything (even blank).
%%
%% Sign is for full-sized signs that would cover most of a large
%% manila envelope; SignMedium is for signs sized to half-sized manila
%% envelopes; SignSmall is for signs sized for small manila envelopes
%% (the same size as item cards).  Label, LabelMedium, and LabelSmall
%% are analagous, but they don't have a \takedownby note at the
%% bottom.  You can always use a sign or label without an envelope or
%% with a differently-sized envelope.  Choose which based on
%% visibility and content.
%%
%% SignTiny is for signs you want to be hard to find; it is small and
%% does not have a \takedownby note.  SignDot is for a very small
%% "dot" which only has a title.
%%
%% SignStrip produces a strip of paper (without a \takedownby note)
%% with labels on the outside that show on both sides if you fold it
%% in half.  These are a convenient alternative to sub-envelopes. They
%% can also be used for "s-packets" taped to walls (see
%% Extras/README-s-packets).
%%
%% LabelCover produces a label similar to the cover to a research
%% notebook.  LabelPage, likewise, produces a page.
%%
%% EOG is for full-sized end-of-game signs.

As the chief diplomat of the Assyrian Dominion, there are several facts you ought to be apprised of before you arrive at the royal wedding - potential points of contention that you should be prepared to defuse if tensions escalate. An Etruscan merchant of no small wealth named \cMerchant{} has unearthed the ancient Diadem of the Sabines, and plans to sell it to one of the nations in attendance; the treasuries of Scythia and Etruria will doubtless vie for such a prize. Moreover, if worst comes to worst, both rulers have brought with them devices for communicating with their armies. With these communicators, they have the ability to ignite a vicious war such as the Sabine nations have never before seen. These are sophisticated magical devices with several keys. Our intelligence has been able to determine that the number pressed dictates the intensity of the attack. Pressing the key marked ''0'' should convey no military order; higher numbers command subsequently more aggressive courses of action. Of course, I pray the wedding goes smoothly, and that neither side resorts to such desperate measures. But the knowledge is available to you should you require it.

May Jove smile upon you, may your words be heeded by all, and may peace be the will of the gods.

Sincerely,
The Secretary-Consul of Assyria
