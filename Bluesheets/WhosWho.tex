\emph{Commoners:}

\cButler{} is the young steward of the Scythian court, tasked with ensuring that the wedding festivities go off without a hitch. The ascension of one so green to such a trusted position is unprecedented in a Sabine court. It is rumored that \cButler{\they} carries ties to the Scythian order of Soulblades and their esoteric magic.

\cBurglar{} is a fortuneteller traveling with the Scythian delegation, a young \cBurglar{\human} with the gift of insight chosen by the Scythian court to bless the happy couple. As the royal seers are chosen based solely on their talent for the art of divination, the \cBurglar{\human} carries neither lands nor title, and \cBurglar{\they} is a curiosity among the guests for both \cBurglar{\their} unknown heritage and for the fortunes \cBurglar{\they} will reveal to them.

\cArmsDealer{} is an arms merchant whose status as the wealthiest merchant in Scythia got \cArmsDealer{\them} invited to the royal wedding as an “ambassador of the common people.” A cutthroat profiteer whose services and products go without exception to the highest bidder, \cArmsDealer{\their} military innovations have nevertheless proved effective - perhaps chillingly so - at securing Scythia’s borders against barbarians.

\cAssassin{} is the chief steward of the Etruscan court, an elderly but dedicated attendant who has served the crown for decades without fail or complaint. Not a detail passes before \cAssassin{\their} eyes that \cAssassin{\they} does not sign off on, and with \cAssassin{\them} in charge of the royal wedding, it will take a miracle to derail the Etruscan arrangements.

\cFugitive{} is a mysterious fortuneteller accompanying the Etruscan party, a ragged no-name plucked from the ranks of Etruria’s commoners to share \cFugitive{\their} prophetic knack with the gathered nobles. \cFugitive{\Their} very talent for divination magic is an astonishment, however - fortunetelling blood traditionally runs in noble veins, and for a mere itinerant to prove the most talented diviner in all of Etruria is either a startling revelation, an unlikely stroke of luck, or a cunning hoax. Particularly surprising is the fact that two commoners, \cFugitive{} and her opposite number \cBurglar{}, are serving as diviners for the wedding.

\cMerchant{} is a luxury goods merchant, salesman par excellence, and the wealthiest of Etruria’s small merchant class - an “ambassador of the common people” for the Etruscan court, though \cMerchant{\they} little resembles the average citizen of that impoverished nation. For the wedding festivities, \cMerchant{} has brought a one-of-a-kind relic to celebrate the reunification of Etruria and Scythia: the fabled Diadem of the Sabines. 

\cAnarchist{} is a well-respected Assyrian professor of astronomy and the \cAnarchist{\sibling} of \cMerchant{}, chosen to support the diplomat Sirasu in his peacekeeping efforts.

Sirasu Noon is a renowned Assyrian lawyer diplomat, master Senet player, and brilliant political theorist. His scholar’s eye, talent for objective assessment, and incisive mind enable him to resolve nearly any conflict - whether it’s a territorial dispute, an academic debate, or a blood feud about to erupt in violence, Sirasu is the one who dials down the tensions and makes even the most entrenched opponents see reason. It’s said sometimes that there are only two great minds left in the Sabine kingdoms - \cEtruriaKing{\Monarch} \cEtruriaKing{} of Etruria, and Sirasu Noon.

\cArchaeologist{} is an Assyrian archaeologist, lover of antiquities, and social butterfly. 

\emph{Royals (From Eldest to Youngest):}

\cEtruriaKing{} is the \cEtruriaKing{\monarch} of Etruria, an icy and brilliant \cEtruriaKing{\human} whose intellect is matched only by \cEtruriaKing{\their} capacity for ruthlessness. The scion of an upstart dynasty that came to power when \cEtruriaKing{\their} father Hyperion overthrew the old Etruscan queen in a bloody coup, \cEtruriaKing{\they} cares about one thing and one thing only: increasing the power of Etruria by any means necessary. No matter who you are, \cEtruriaKing{\they} is not a \cEtruriaKing{\human} to be trifled with.

\cScythiaKing{} is the well-loved \cScythiaKing{\monarch} of the Scythians. Ever since the kidnapping and death of \cScythiaKing{\their} daughter Thoesi, it’s been rumored that \cScythiaKing{\they} blames \cScythiaKing{\them}self for every life lost to the senseless feud between the two nations.

\cScythiaQueen{} is the \cScythiaQueen{\monarch} of Scythia and the \cScythiaQueen{\spouse} of \cScythiaKing{}. \cScythiaQueen{\They} is a stalwart believer in propriety, chastity, and temperance as the true pillars of Scythian virtue. After the death of \cScythiaQueen{\their} \cFugitive{\offspring}, most likely at Etruscan hands, \cScythiaQueen{} has made no secret of \cScythiaQueen{\their} desire for vengeance, and is also known for \cScythiaQueen{\their} grudge against the mystical Soulblades.

\cGroom{} is the eldest \cGroom{\offspring} of \cEtruriaKing{\Monarch} \cEtruriaKing{} and the deceased Queen Cerintha, and the crown \cGroom{\prince} of Etruria. Rather than studying in Assyria like most royals, \cGroom{\they} chose to remain in Etruria, spending several years as an archaeologist studying the ancient capital of the Sabine Empire. Staunchly loyal to the Etruscan crown, unflinchingly honest, and astonishingly upright, it’s commonly believed that \cGroom{\they}’ll someday make a competent but boring king.

\cBride{} is the only surviving child of \cScythiaKing{} and \cScythiaQueen{}, and heir to the Scythian throne. \cBride{\They} studied law at one of Assyria’s finest universitites. \cBride{\They} is betrothed to \cGroom{}, the Etruscan crown \cGroom{\prince}, and today’s wedding will see the two bound together in sacred matrimony. 

\cPoet{} is the younger brother of \cGroom{\Prince} \cGroom{}, and \cPoet{\they} is everything \cPoet{\their} \cGroom{\sibling} is not.  Rake, poet, gambler, liar, this dashing and tragic young \cPoet{\human} is notorious for \cPoet{\their} foppish pride.

\cWard{} is the adoptive son of \cScythiaKing{} and \cScythiaQueen{}, the child of a noble friend of \cScythiaQueen{}’s who was killed in a border raid by Etruscan troops, though \cWard{\they} has not been formally welcomed into the line of succession. \cWard{\They} was known for being rather irresponsible – rumor has it \cWard{\they} never got along well with \cWard{\their} adoptive family. \cWard{\They} is now studying in Assyria, as is customary for young royals.
