\name{\gScythiaDiadem{}}

In a private meeting with the Etruscan treasurer, you presented the possibility of buying the Diadem from the merchant \cMerchant{}. Given the legendary status of the Diadem, the treasury has authorized you to offer a maximum of 2,000,000 coins for it. However, this is an astronomical sum, and the treasurer fervently hopes you can obtain the Diadem for less.

\cScythiaKing{} currently has a check that will let you pay for the Diadem, once you strike a bargain with \cMerchant{}.
