Talk to a person for 2 minutes and get to know them. Roll a d20; if you roll a 2-20, you can read their fortune, and, by kludge, you must immediately relay the fortune by showing them the page in your book. On a 1, you are unable to read that person’s fortune, and they take 1 point of psychic damage instead. You can try to read their fortune again in the future.

You can read someone’s fortune without their consent. However, you must still show them your findings immediately, and they are still take 1 point of psychic damage if you roll a 1. Moreover, once you attempt to read someone’s fortune without having their permission, you cannot try reading anyone’s fortune for five minutes afterwards. 

You can only read one fortune for any one person. No two fortune tellers will read the same fortune for one person. Fortune-telling offers all manner of rewards-- valuable information, insight into the deeper workings of your world, and extra magical powers.  Seize the day, and read as many fortunes as you can.
