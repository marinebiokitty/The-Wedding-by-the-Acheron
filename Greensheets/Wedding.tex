\name{\gWedding{}}

A wedding is a solemn ritual, handed down for millennia. For a full minute, the couple must stand together before an altar, while the altar's flame is burning. They must vow to be faithful and to take care of one another; these vows may be composed ahead of time, or spoken ex tempore, from the heart. This exchange of vows is interruptible. Each person being married must be accompanied by a "witness of honor"-- some friend, relative, mentor, or other person they care about deeply. The two witnesses of honor must stand behind the couple while they exchange vows in order for the marriage to be valid. However, everyone present at the resort is expected to be in attendance; being absent from the ceremony is considered a sign of disrespect.

Wedding altars themselves are unusual artifacts, laden with many enchantments. Their flames only burn for the ten minutes while the sun sets on the first day of summer. If the marriage is valid, then the altar will produce temporary, illusory golden bracelets around the wrists of the happy couple.

In order for a marriage to be valid, both partners and their witnesses must be alive, conscious, and unrestrained. Furthermore, neither partner can be under the age of 18 or already married to somebody else, and the two partners cannot be closely related by blood.

Divorce does not exist. Marriages are ended only by the death of one or both partners.
