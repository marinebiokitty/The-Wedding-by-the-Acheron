You can figure out roughly how much an item is worth.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Item #0000-0003 are worth less than 1 gold coin each.
\item Item #0004 is worth 10 gold coins.
\item Item #0005 is worth less than 1 gold coin.
\item It is difficult to evaluate #0006's worth. Ask a GM.

\item Rate how knowledgeable you are about the topic of your statement, again using a scale of 1-3 (1 = completely uninformed, 2 =  somewhat informed, 3 = well-informed). For example, an Etruscan cook might know a great deal about Etruscan recipes (3), could make reasonable guesses about Assyrian cuisine (2), and can't speak with any confidence at all about esot1eric legal philosophy (1).
\end{enumerate}
