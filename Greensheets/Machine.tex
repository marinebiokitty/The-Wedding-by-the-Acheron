Your company has provided several armies with hugely expensive magical communication machines. These machines always come in pairs-- one for the leading strategist, one for headquarters. The strategist's machine is equipped with a number of buttons (usually two to four), each of which sends a specific message. The machine at HQ receives these messages, monitoring which button on the strategist's machine is pressed at any point; it has no buttons and cannot be used to send messages. The strategist's machine sends out one message a day-- precisely at sundown, it tells HQ which button is currently pressed.

Thanks to cutting-edge (and again hugely expensive) cryptography research, it is practically impossible to intercept or tamper with the messages without physically accessing the strategist's machine. However, an intruder who directly accesses the strategist's machine can press a new button and thus send out a different message. Moreover, you-- thanks to your personal experience with such machines-- can figure out exactly what the different messages are. Traditionally, a button marked "0" corresponds to "No Attack," while buttons with larger numbers order larger attacks, but you have no guarantee that either Etruria or Scythia follows this tradition.
