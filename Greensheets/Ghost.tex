Take this greensheet upon dying if you had a soul at time of death.

You feel this island's strange energy ripping your soul from your body, transforming you into a ghost, and you suddenly have a great many insights into the afterlife. Your corpse disappears, leaving all the items that are still on your person in its place. Put on a solid-colored headband, signifying you are a ghost.

Most living creatures cannot see or hear ghosts, but ghosts can see and hear each other. Ghosts cannot manipulate physical matter or leave this island. However, you can still freely walk around this resort as you did in life; you still cannot pass through solid material or enter locked areas. If you hear the ringing of a bell, you are instinctually compelled to seek out the source of the music. 

Based on your condition at the time of your death, you may have some other special abilities . . . 

- If you had a psychic health score over 0 at the time of your death, you can talk freely, though only ghosts and a few strange living creatures will hear you. Otherwise, you are rendered mute.

- If your psychic health was at least 4 at the time of your death, you earn a special ability. Get an ability card from the G packet.

- If your psychic health max was at least 7 at the time of your death, you earn a special ability. Get an ability card from the H packet.


(Out-of-game note: Please try to be discreet ghosts, to avoid distracting players whose characters cannot see or hear you).
