My character is evaluating your character's statement with truthing magic. Complete the following steps, speaking quietly so other players do not overhear your answers. Then give me back this greensheet:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Rate how straightforward your recent statement was on a scale of 1-3 (1 = completely dishonest, 2 = ambiguous, 3 = completely honest). 
\item Rate how knowledgeable you are about the topic of your statement, again using a scale of 1-3 (1 = completely uninformed, 2 =  somewhat informed, 3 = well-informed). 
\end{enumerate}
