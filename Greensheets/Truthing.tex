My character is evaluating your character's statement with truthing magic. This interaction is out-of-game, and we must both go "not here." You must answer honestly as an out-of-game statement.
Complete the following steps, speaking quietly so other players do not overhear your answers. Then give me back this greensheet:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Rate how straightforward your recent statement was on a scale of 1-3 (1 = completely dishonest, 2 = ambiguous, 3 = completely honest). 
\item Rate how knowledgeable you are about the topic of your statement, again using a scale of 1-3 (1 = completely uninformed, 2 =  somewhat informed, 3 = well-informed). For example, an Etruscan cook might know a great deal about Etruscan recipes (3), could make reasonable guesses about Assyrian cuisine (2), and can't speak with any confidence at all about esoteric legal philosophy (1).
\end{enumerate}
