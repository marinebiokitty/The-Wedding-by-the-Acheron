\name{\gBluffmaster{}}

Bluffmaster is a game of skill, represented out-of-game as a game of chance. It involves gambling, and many great fortunes have been lost and won at a Bluffmaster table.

To play, you and at least one other player must sit down around a triangular table designed for Bluffmaster. To begin a round, every player must put a minimum bet of 5 gold pieces into the "pot"-- a space at the center of the table. 

Next, everyone rolls a d20. The person with the highest score is the "starter." Ties are resolved by re-rolling.
