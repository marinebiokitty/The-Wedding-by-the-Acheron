Gods, forgive me. I?ve already failed. I can feel my flesh rotting beneath my skin even as I write these words, corrupted by the foul kiss of poison. I know now that I am doomed, though I can only guess at the identities of those responsible. I suspect that I will die before the sun sets, and I fear this wedding, too, will end in bloodshed and strife. Please, for my sake, for the sake of peace, in the name of all the gods of Olympus, do not let my death turn you against each other. Do not let rage consume your reason, lest the wrath of divine prophecy tear all our nations asunder. Please ? \cScythiaKing{\Monarch} \cScythiaQueen{\Monarch}, \cEtruriaKing{\Monarch} \cEtruriaKing{} ? if you read this, know that I would have your nations be brothers once more, not bitter rivals. Know that I would have done everything in my power to prevent war. Know that I would have at least tried. I beg of you to do the same. I am sorry...
