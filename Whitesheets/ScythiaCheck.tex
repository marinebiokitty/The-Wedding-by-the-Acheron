\emph{(This is an in-game, transferable item. You are magically prevented from signing if you are not the character in question, or if your character does not honestly agree with the statement.)}

We, the members of the Council of the Treasury of the Kingdom of Scythia, do hereby authorize \cScythiaKing{\Monarch} \cScythiaKing{\MYname} and \cScythiaQueen{\Monarch} \cScythiaQueen{\MYname}  (or the current ruler of Scythia, should both of the aforementioned monarchs become deceased) to provide the merchant \cMerchant {\MYname} with a sum of their discretion in exchange for an artifact known colloquially as the Diadem. This check is backed by the full wealth of the Scythian Treasury, and, once it is completed and signed, can be exchanged for gold.
